# Workshop Four: Divide and Conquer Algorithms, Recursion

**Divide and Conquer Algorithms Recursion**

Recursion is a powerful programming technique that involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems of the same type, solving those subproblems, and then combining their solutions to solve the original problem.

**Understanding Recursive Thinking**

Recursive thinking involves identifying a problem that can be divided into smaller instances of the same problem. The key is to recognize the pattern of self-similarity, where the solution to the larger problem can be constructed from the solutions to its subproblems.

**Demonstrating Recursive Methods**

A recursive method is a function that calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. It typically has two main components:

1. **Base case:** The simplest case that can be solved directly without further recursion.

2. **Recursive case:** The case where the problem is divided into smaller subproblems, and the method calls itself to solve those subproblems.

**Writing a Recursive Algorithm**

To write a recursive algorithm, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the base case:** Define the simplest case that can be solved directly.

2. **Break down the problem:** Divide the problem into smaller subproblems of the same type.

3. **Make the recursive call:** Call the same function to solve the subproblems.

4. **Combine solutions:** Combine the solutions of the subproblems to solve the original problem.

**Tracing a Recursive Algorithm**

Tracing a recursive algorithm involves following the execution of the function calls and understanding how the subproblems are solved and their solutions combined.

**Recognizing Tail-End Recursion**

Tail-end recursion occurs when the recursive call is the last operation in the function. It can be optimized by the compiler to avoid unnecessary stack growth.

**Removing Tail-End Recursion**

Tail-end recursion can be removed by converting the recursive call into an iterative loop. This can improve efficiency by reducing stack usage.

**Comparing Recursive and Iterative Techniques**

Recursive and iterative techniques are both used to solve problems. Recursion is often more elegant and concise, while iteration may be more efficient in terms of memory usage.

**Applying Backtracking Techniques**

Backtracking is a problem-solving technique that involves exploring possible solutions and abandoning paths that don't lead to a valid solution. It often employs recursion to systematically try different options.

**Example: Calculating Factorial**

The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted as n!, is the product of all positive integers from 1 to n. Here's a recursive implementation:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:  # Base case
        return 1
    else:  # Recursive case
        return n * factorial(n-1)
```

This function calls itself recursively until it reaches the base case (n=0), then it unwinds, multiplying the returned values to compute the factorial.
